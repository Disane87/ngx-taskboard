Instead, you have to build it with ng build . --watch and link it with npm link. The link process creates a symlink to your global npm which you can access from other projects.\nIn your test or real project, you have to add the package, but only with another command npm link @disane/ngx-taskboard --save. This means, you are not obtaining the package from npm, instead you are symlinking it to you global npm which has a reference to the above created link in your project.\nThis is a bit odd, but you can read more about it here.\nIf you have an existing Angular library project with a tets application, you can work here with submoduling in git, instead of a git clone:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/Disane87/ngx-taskboard.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 Marco Franke\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
